intro_title: Meet Indapot
intro: "<p>Horticulture hasn’t changed much in, oh, a couple of millenia. Neither
  have pots. We’re using the same terra cotta containers as the ancient Greeks. I
  mean, Aristotle was a smart guy, but you shouldn’t have to plant your perennials
  like he did.</p> <p>Indapot gives you a reason to break those clay pots on purpose
  — instead of by accident, which is how you’ve been breaking them since forever.
  That’s because Indapot is a really real, totally not hyperbolic, super legit revolution
  in home gardening.</p> <p>How revolutionary are we talking here? Let’s just say
  that you could stick a tri-corner hat on one of these bad boys and send it across
  the Delaware. (How cute would that be, by the way? Little George Washington-looking
  planter.)</p> <p>Okay, on to our Declaration of Indo-pendence! (Be prepared, the
  puns are going to come hot and fast.)</p>"
benefits_better:
- title: Unbreakable
  content: Because Indapots are made from silicone, this makes them virtually unbreakable.
    Crush them, drop them, run them over with a car or drop them off a roof and these
    pots will bounce right back. These pots can take about anything and look great
    doing it. These pots will never fail you and you will own them for a lifetime.

- title: Lightweight
  content: When compared to clay and terra-cotta pots, Indapots are about 60% lighter.
    Expect less strain on your back when moving plants around.
  image: assets/images/photo-4.jpg
- title: Pliable
  content: The fact that you can flex Indapots means you will be able to remove plants
    from them with ease. Being pliable is also a reason that these pots will never
    break on you.

- title: Rigid
  content: Even though these pots can be flexed, they have been designed to stay as
    rigid as you need to stand up to the weight of gardening. We used a silicone that
    will both flex and hold up to weight.
  image: assets/images/photo-7.jpg
- title: Resilient
  content: Indapots have taken everything we have thrown at them. We have thrown them
    off roofs, set off explosions inside of them, and even released children on them.
    We have looked for any way we can to damage them. The resilience of these pots
    is just one of the reason you will own them for a lifetime.

- title: Colorfast/UV Stable
  content: The fact that Indapots are made from silicone means they’re UV stable.
    You don’t have to worry about fading, no matter what colors you choose. Your plants
    enjoy the sun and now your pots can too.

- title: Food grade and hypoallergenic
  content: Unlike those plastic containers, Indapot isn’t made from petroleum products.
    These silicone pots can withstand heating and freezing without leaching or off-gassing.
    So you won’t have to worry about any BPA’s or hazardous chemicals contaminating
    your food. You can rest assured the food you have grown is safe and healthy for
    your whole family.

- title: Dishwasher safe
  content: At the end of a season or before your next growing season begins, you can
    run our pots through the dishwasher.  Now you can be sure your pots are nice and
    clean before being potted again. You can do this season after season with no damage
    to your pots.

- title: Recyclable
  content: 'Like most all silicone products, Indapots are recyclable. With their extremely
    long life, you will probably never get rid of these pots. But if you do for some
    reason, they can be recycled. If your local facility doesn’t recycle silicone,
    then you can always send them back to us and we will either recycle them, or donate
    them to schools for future use. '

- title: Not plastic and not clay
  content: Indapots cover the needs of gardeners in a multitude of ways. They are
    60% lighter than clay pots. So there is no need to hurt your back when moving
    them around. But they still have the rigidity needed to hold shape when moving
    them so not to damage your roots. But they will also flex when forced so transplanting
    is a cinch. Unlike clay pots these pots will never fade.
