title: Frequently Asked Questions
questions:
- question: Why platinum-cured silicone?
  answer: Indapot plant containers are 100% platinum-cured silicone, the highest grade
    available that passes all U.S. and European safety standards. It is food grade,
    oven safe (to 450 degrees), freeze safe, and dishwasher safe. Other products may
    claim that their product is "food grade" but unless it is pure platinum-cured
    silicone, you should be cautious of how it can be safely used.
- question: What retailer will sell Indapots?
  answer: We are already in the process of selecting our first group of partners to
    sell Indapots in their stores. When they are available, we will have a store locator
    on our website to help you find a store in your area.
- question: Why are Indapots better for your health?
  answer: Traditional plastic containers are petroleum-based and can contain harmful
    chemicals. Because Indapots are made from 100% platinum-cured silicone, it is
    free of BPA, lead, phthalates and PVC. It is also hypoallergenic.
- question: Why are Indapots better for the environment?
  answer: Indapot plant containers are built to last and can potentially be used thousands
    of times. You can replace your thin plastic and terra-cotta pots, reducing unnecessary
    waste.
- question: Are Indapots recyclable?
  answer: Yes, at specific silicone recyclers. You can also send them back to us and
    we will recycle them or donate them to local gardening programs!
- question: Are indapots dishwasher safe?
  answer: YES! They were designed for the dishwasher and many other cleaning methods.
    Just pop them in the dishwasher and they will come out nice and clean. We recommend
    using a biodegradable soap so you don’t leave any unwanted chemicals on your pots.
- question: Why should I pre-order?
  answer: We are prioritizing our shipments based on when orders are placed. If you
    want to be one of the first people to receive an Indapot, place a pre-order and
    secure your priority position in our shipping queue.

    within 14 days of receipt if they are in new, unused condition and in the original
    packaging. Qualifying refunds are issued for the purchase price and any taxes

- question: I’m a retailer can I sell Indapots?
  answer: We would love to discuss your store and the possibilities of partnering
    to sell Indapots to your customers. Please send information about your shop to <a
    href="mailto:info@indapots.com">info@indapots.com</a> and we will contact you
    shortly.
- question: Is the material ridged enough to make pots?
  answer: Silicone is rated by shore hardness. Most silicone products such as pot
    holders and soft kitchen equipment are shore 40a-60a; they are made to be floppy.
    We are using platinum-cured silicone with a shore hardness of shore 80a. This
    means that pots will both be flexible and have the rigidity needed to hold shape.
    We have put a lot of time in finding the correct hardness scale to make these
    the best pots you will ever purchase. Some of our smaller products such as the
    6 packs will be made from a slightly lower shore rated material to get the desired
    bendability needed to get your plants out without damaging them. Our material
    will far outperform any of those products for a lifetime.
- question: How long will Indapots last?
  answer: Indapots are made from platinum-grade silicone. They are made to last as
    long as you are still gardening, then you can give them to your grandkids. and
    they can use them. Silicone is naturally a highly durable material they’re weather
    resistant, Temperature resistant (-80° – 450° F), fungus / bacterial resistant,
    can be crushed over and over. Throw it on the ground, jump on it, set your children
    loose with soccer balls, Indapots can take it all.
- question: Will the color fade over time?
  answer: Rest assured that the color will stay strong long into the future. Silicone
    is a color fast material, meaning it will not fade due to UV exposure. Just rinse
    off the dirt and your pots will be as shiny as the day you bought them.
