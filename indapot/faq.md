questions:
- question: ''
  answer: ''
- question: Why platinum-cured silicone?
  answer: Indapot plant containers are 100% platinum-cured silicone, the highest grade
    available that passes all U.S. and European safety standards. It is food safe,
    oven safe (to 450 degrees), microwave safe, freezer safe, and dishwasher safe.
    Other products may claim that their product is "food safe" but unless it is pure
    platinum-cured silicone, you should be cautious of how it can be safely used.
- question: Why are Indapots better for your health?
  answer: Traditional plastic containers are petroleum based and can contain harmful
    chemicals. Because Indapot is made from 100% platinum-cured silicone, it is free
    of BPA, lead, phthalates and PVC. It is also hypoallergenic.
- question: Why is it better for the environment?
  answer: Indapot plant containers are built to last and can potentially be used thousands
    of times replacing all of the thin plastic pots and terrcotta which will reduce
    waste.
- question: Are Indapots recyclable?
  answer: Yes, at specific silicone recyclers. You can also send them back to us and
    we will use recycle them or use them to make more Indapots!
- question: Are indapots dishwasher safe?
  answer: YES! They were designed for the dishwasher, or many other cleaning methods.
    Just pop them in the dishwasher and they will come out nice and clean. They are
    top or bottom rack safe too! We do recommend using a biodegradable soap so not
    to leave any unwanted chemicals on the pots.
- question: Why should I pre-order?
  answer: We are prioritizing our shipments based on when they are placed. If you
    want to be one of the first people to receive Zip Top containers, place a pre-order
    and secure your priority position in our shipping queue.

- question: What retailer will sell Indapots?
  answer: We are already in the process of selecting our first group of partners to
    sell Zip Top in their stores. When they are available, we will have a store locator
    on our website to help you find a store in your area.
- question: I’m a retailer can I sell Indapots?
  answer: We would love to discuss your store and the possibilities of partnering
    to sell Zip Top to your customers. Please send information about your shop to <a
    href="mailto:info@indapots.com">info@indapots.com</a> and we will contact you
    shortly.
- question: Is the material ridged enough to make pots?
  answer: Silicone is rated by shore hardness. Most things like pot holders and soft
    kitchen equipment are shore 40a-60a. Meaning they are made to be floppy. We are
    using Platinum cured silicone with a shore hardness of shore 80a. This means that
    it will both be flexible and hold the rigidity needed to hold shape for our pots.
    We have put a lot of time in finding the correct hardness scale to make these
    the best pots you will ever purchase. Some of our smaller products such as the
    6 packs will be made from a slightly lower shore rated material to get the desired
    bendability needed to get your plants out without damaging them. Just remember
    you have been using thin very breakable plastic for years. Our material will far
    outperform any of those products for a life time.
- question: How long will Indapots last?
  answer: Indapots are made from platinum grade silicone. So they are made to last
    as long as you are still gardening, then you can give them to your grandkids and
    they can use them. Silicone is naturally a highly durable material they’re weather
    resistant, Temperature resistant, fungus / bacterial resistant, can be crushed
    over and over. Throw it on the ground, jump on it, set your children loose with
    soccer balls, Indapots can take it all.
- question: Will the color fade over time?
  answer: Rest assured that the color will stay strong long into the future. Silicone
    is a color fast material, meaning it will not fade due to UV exposure. Jst rinse
    off the dirt and your pots will be shiny as the day you bought them.
