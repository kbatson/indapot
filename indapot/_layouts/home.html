        <div class="hero__content">
            <p>Horticulture hasn’t changed much in, oh, a couple of millenia. Neither have pots. We’re using the same terra cotta containers as the ancient Greeks. I mean, Aristotle was a smart guy, but you shouldn’t have to plant your perennials like he did.</p>
            <p>Indapot gives you a reason to break those clay pots on purpose — instead of by accident, which is how you’ve been breaking them since forever. That’s because Indapot is a really real, totally not hyperbolic, super legit revolution in home gardening.</p>
            <p>How revolutionary are we talking here? Let’s just say that you could stick a tri-corner hat on one of these bad boys and send it across the Delaware. (How cute would that be, by the way? Little George Washington-looking planter.)</p>
            <p>Okay, on to our Declaration of Indo-pendence! (Be prepared, the puns are going to come hot and fast.)</p>

                <p>Never met a temperature it didn’t like. Okay, it didn’t like -150 or 600 degrees Fahrenheit. Still! Also, silicone is nonporous, so it freezes and thaws like a champ — no fracture or failure. This thing can even take on acids and radiation. (What are you, a mad scientist or something?)</p>

                <p>Indapots repel water and sunlight like superheroes deflect bullets. They do not, however, deflect bullets. Our lawyers forced us to say that. Anyway, your Indapots won’t fade or break down because of weather or UV exposure.</p>

                <p>Efflorescence is a thing of the past. No, we did not make that word up — it means “salt build-up.” Forget chemical build-up, too. Really, with Indapot, the only thing you’ll be building up is confidence in your green thumb.</p>
